I have worked for a local mortgage banking company for the past 5 years and have held a variety of positions. Most recently in July 2017 I decided to breakoff from the team I was working on to give myself more time to focus on the sales side full time.  

I wasn't sure how I wanted to market myself on my own. Not sure if I wanted to focus on social media and if so, in what capacity.  I decided to start working on a blog and what I discovered was that I was more interested in the technical and creative side.  I couldn't find a theme or template for how I envisioned my blog to be. I had purchased two different themes and came to the realization that if I wanted to do my blog right I was going to need to create the website from scratch myself. Not only that but what I was looking for in terms of my own website, is something that I had a hard time finding and I'm sure there are many other women out there looking for the same beautiful website.

All that aside, I went to school to be a high school math teacher.  In my final semester at school I took a CS class that I had been putting off.  I loved it.  Designing the program spacially and the code to make it run was the most challenging thing I had done in school. I'd spend hours in the lab trying to make my code work and when it did I would literally let out a loud YES in excitement!  I said to my boyfriend, now husband...
> "if I had taken this class sooner, I either would have hated it because I couldn't appreciate it, or I would have changed my major."

It's funny how things work out.  I've always been a motivated person and driven by my goals.  I wouldn't say I had my whole life planned out but I knew what I wanted big picture. Part of figuring out life and reaching goals is realizing that adapting your goals is essential.  I'm not the same person now that I was when I chose my degree in college.  I'm not even the same person I was when I started my first business job post teaching.  Everything I have experienced in my life has led me to where I am today.  

I realized that sitting for hours building my website was what I wanted to be doing. When I started digging deeper into the possibilities I realized that a bootcamp was perfect for my life.  I learn quickly and am "all in" when I started anything.  When I learned more about the coding world, I realized that what I knew was just the tip of the iceburg and I am so excited to see what I learn and what areas pique my interest.
