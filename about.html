<p>When I was in high school I had this really awesome Calculus teacher. I wanted to be exactly like her. She was that hip teacher that taught upper-level classes and headed up different organizations at school.  I studied math and education in college to go on to become a high school math teacher just like her. Needless to say, I was less than interested in being a teacher after my first year. I realized just because you like math, and enjoy learning, doesn't mean you are meant to teach it.  I got married, switched careers to the banking industry, got a puppy, and had a baby.  Recently my life presented an opportunity to break off on my own in the mortgage industry which pushed me to explore a creative outlet for marketing and sales with a blog. In the process of getting my blog up, I realized how much I loved the dev side and that inspired me to pursue this opportunity.  We're never too old to embrace life's new directions!</p>
